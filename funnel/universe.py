#
# The alternative was a hand-checked list, which is how this started —
# five entries, each argued individually, on the reasoning that the right
# line is not guessable from the letter (Alphabet's plain ticker is the
# non-voting retail line; for Fox and News Corp the "A" line is the
# widely traded one). That reasoning was sound and it does not scale: it
# needs a human decision every time the index changes, and by the time
# the universe reached 1,500 it had produced two rules that contradicted
# each other on Alphabet.
#
# A published field decided by someone else beats a judgement of ours,
# even a well-argued one. The cost of the switch is that Alphabet is now
# GOOGL rather than GOOG — the two track each other within a fraction of
# a percent, so no gate or price reading moves.
#
# Companies the SEC file does not carry at all (CWEN-A) need no entry:
# they never match a filer and drop out here on their own.
